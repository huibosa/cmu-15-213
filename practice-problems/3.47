Running our stack-checking code 10,000 times on a system running Linux ver-
sion 2.6.16, we obtained addresses ranging from a minimum of 0xffffb754 to a
maximum of 0xffffd754.

A. What is the approximate range of addresses?
----------------------------------------------
2^13

B. If we attempted a buffer overrun with a 128-byte nop sled, about how many
attempts would it take to test all starting addresses?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2^6
