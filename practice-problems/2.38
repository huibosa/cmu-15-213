(a<<k) + b

Considering cases where b is either 0 or equal to a, and all possible values of
k, what multiples of a can be computed with a single lea instruction?

lea   (0, a, 1) = a
lea   (a, a, 1) = 2a
lea   (0, a, 2) = 2a
lea   (a, a, 2) = 3a
lea   (0, a, 4) = 4a
lea   (a, a, 4) = 5a
lea   (0, a, 8) = 8a
lea   (a, a, 8) = 9a
