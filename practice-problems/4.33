irmovq $5, %rdx
irmovq $0x100,%rsp
rmmovq %rdx,0(%rsp)
popq %rsp
nop
nop
rrmovq %rsp,%rax

The two nop instructions will cause the popq instruction to be in the
write-back stage when the rrmovq instruction is in the decode stage. If the two
forwarding sources in the write-back stage are given the wrong priority, then
register %rax will be set to the incremented program counter rather than the
value read from memory.
