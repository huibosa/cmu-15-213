xorq %rcx, %rcx

1. This instruction is used to set register %rcx to zero, exploiting the
   property that x ^ x = 0 for any x. It corresponds to the C statement x = 0.
2. A more direct way of setting register %rcx to zero is with the instruction
   movq $0,%rcx.
3. Assembling and disassembling this code, however, we find that the version
   with xorq requires only 3 bytes, while the version with movq requires 7.
   Other ways to set %rcx to zero rely on the property that any instruction
   that updates the lower 4 bytes will cause the high-order bytes to be set to
   zero. Thus, we could use either xorl %ecx,%ecx (2 bytes) or movl $0,%ecx (5
   bytes).
