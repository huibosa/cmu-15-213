poptest:
  movq %rsp, %rdi         Save stack pointer
  pushq $0xabcd           Push test value
  popq %rsp               Pop to stack pointer
  movq %rsp, %rax         Set popped value as return value
  movq %rdi, %rsp         Restore stack pointer
  ret

This code sequence pushes 0xabcd onto the stack, pops to %rsp, and returns the
popped value. Since the result equals 0xabcd, we can deduce that popq %rsp sets
the stack pointer to the value read from memory. It is therefore equivalent to
the instruction mrmovq (%rsp),%rsp.
