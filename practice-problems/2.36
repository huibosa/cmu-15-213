int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {
  /* Compute product without overflow */
  int64_t pll = (int64_t)x * y;
  /* See if casting to int preserves value */
  return pll == (int)pll;
}

Note that the casting on the right-hand side of line 5 is critical. If we
instead wrote the line as

int64_t pll = x*y;

the product would be computed as a 32-bit value (possibly overflowing) and then
sign extended to 64 bits.
