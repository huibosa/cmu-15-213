### 4.1.3 Instruction Encoding

* The program registers are stored within the CPU in a **register file**, a
  small random access memory where the register IDs serve as addresses.
* On the CISC side, it has condition codes and variable-length instructions,
  and it uses the stack to store return addresses.
* On the RISC side, it uses a load/store architecture and a regular instruction
  encoding, and it passes procedure arguments through registers.

### 4.1.4 Y86-64 Exceptions

### 4.1.5 Y86-64 Programmers

### 4.1.6 Some Y86-64 Instruction Details

1. Push the original value of `%rsp`
2. Push the decremented value of `%rsp`.

## 4.2 Logic Design and the Hardware Control Language HCL

Three major components are required to implement a digital system:

1. *Combinational logic* to compute functions on the bits.
2. *Memory elements* to store bits.
3. *Clock signals* to regulate the updating of the memory elements.

### Logic Gates

### 4.2.2 Combinational Circuits and HCL Boolean Expressions

Several restrictions are placed on how the combinational circuits are
constructed:

* Every logic gate input must be connected to exactly one of the following:
  1. One of the system inputs (known as a *primary input*)
  2. The output connection of some memory element
  3. The output of some logic gate.
* The outputs of two or more logic gates cannot be connected together.
* The network must be `acyclic`.

#### Xor

```
bool eq = (a && b) || (!a && !b)
```

#### Multiplexor

```
bool out = (s && a) | (!s && b)
```

### 4.2.3 Word-Level Combinational Circuits and HCL Integer Expressions

HCL allows words to be compared for equality, and so the functionality of the
circuit shown in Figure 4.12 can be expressed at the word level as


```
bool Eq = (A == B)
```

```
int Out = [
  s: A;
  1: B;
]
```

> Allowing nonexclusive selection expressions makes the HCL code more readable.
> An actual hardware multiplexor must have mutually exclusive signals controlling
> which input word should be passed to the output. To translate an HCL case
> expression into hardware, a logic synthesis program would need to analyze the
> set of selection expressions and resolve any possible conflicts by making sure
> that only the first matching case would be selected.

```
word Out4 = [
  !s1 && !s0 : A; # 00
  !s1        : B; # 01
  !s0        : C; # 10
  1          : D; # 11
]
```

For example, the second expression can be written `!s1`, rather than the more
complete `!s1 && s0`, since the only other possibility having `s1` equal to `0` was
given as the first selection expression. Similarly, the third expression can be
written as `!s0`, while the fourth can simply be written as `1`.

```c
word Min3 = [
  A <= B && A <= C : A;
  B <= A && B <= C : B;
  1                : C;
]
```

### 4.2.4 Set Membership

To generate the signals s1 and s0 for the 4-way multiplexor of by selecting the
high- and low-order bits from a 2-bit signal code.

```c
bool s1 = code == 2 || code == 3;
bool s0 = code == 1 || code == 3;

// or a more consise expression
bool s1 = code in {2, 3}
bool s0 = code in {1, 3}
```

### 4.2.5 Memory and Clocking

Sequential circuits: Systems that have state and perform computations on that
state.

Clock: A periodic signal that determines when new values are to be loaded into
the devices.

Clocked registers (or simply registers): Store individual bits or words. The
clock signal controls the loading of the register with the value at its input.

Random access memories (or simply memories): store multiple words, using an
address to select which word should be read or written. Examples of random
access memories include:

1. The *virtual memory* system of a processor, where a combination of hardware
   and operating system software make it appear to a processor that it can
   access any word within a large address space;
2. The *register file*, where register identifiers serve as the addresses. In a
   Y86-64 processor, the register file holds the 15 program registers (%rax
   through %r14).

* This register file has two *read ports*, named A and B, and one *write port*,
  named W.
* Each port has an *address input*, indicating which program register should be
  selected, and a *data output* or input giving a value for that program
  register.
* The addresses are register identifiers,
* The two read ports have address inputs `srcA` and `srcB` and data outputs
  `valA` and `valB`.
* The write port has address input `dstW` and data input `valW`.

> "What happens if the circuit attempts to read and write the same register
> simultaneously?" The answer is straightforward: if the same register ID is
> used for both a read port and the write port, then, as the clock rises, there
> will be a transition on the read portâ€™s data output from the old value to the
> new.

## 4.3 Sequential Y86-64 Implementations

### 4.3.1 Organizing Processing into Stages

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fetch:

* Extracts the two 4-bit portions of the instruction specifier byte, referred
  to as *icode* and *ifun*.
* Or **possibly** fetches a register specifier byte, giving (`rA`) or (`rA` and
  `rB`).
* Or **possibly** fetches an 8-byte constant word `valC`.
* Computes `valP` to be the address of the instruction following the current
  one in sequential order.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decode:

* Reads **up to two** operands from the register file, giving values `valA` and/or
  `valB`.
* Typically, it reads the registers designated by instruction fields `rA` and
  `rB`, but for some instructions it reads register `%rsp`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Execute:

* Or performs the operation specified by the instruction (according to the
  value of `ifun`),
* Or computes the effective address of a memory reference
* Or increments or decrements the stack pointer.
* We refer to the resulting value as `valE`.
* The condition codes are possibly set.
* For a conditional move instruction, the stage will evaluate the condition
  codes and move condition (given by ifun) and enable the updating of the
  destination register only if the condition holds.
* For a jump instruction, it determines whether or not the branch should be
  taken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory:

* May write data to memory, or may read data from memory. We refer to the value
  read as `valM`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write back:

* Writes **up to two** results to the register file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PC update:

* The PC is set to the address of the next instruction.

### 4.3.2 SEQ Hardware Structure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fetch:

* The instruction memory reads the bytes of an instruction.
* The PC incrementer computes `valP`,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Decode:

* The register file has two read ports, A and B, via which register values
  `valA` and `valB` are read simultaneously.

Execute:

* The (ALU) unit for different purposes according to the instruction type.
  * For integer operations, it performs the specified operation.
  * For other instructions, it serves as an adder to compute an incremented or
    decremented stack pointer, to compute an effective address,
  * Or simply to pass one of its inputs to its outputs by adding zero.
* The condition code register (CC) holds the three condition code bits.
  * New values for the condition codes are computed by the ALU.
  * When executing a conditional move instruction, the decision as to whether
    or not to update the destination register is computed based on the
    condition codes and move condition.
  * Similarly, when executing a jump instruction, the branch signal `Cnd` is
    computed based on the condition codes and the jump type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory:

* The data memory reads or writes a word of memory when executing a memory
  instruction. The instruction and data memories access the same memory
  locations, but for different purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write back:

* The register file has two write ports.
  * Port E is used to write values computed by the ALU,
  * Port M is used to write values read from the data memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PC update:

* The new value of the program counter is selected to be either
  * valP, the address of the next instruction.
  * valC, the destination address specified by a call or jump instruction.
  * valM, the return address read from memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware required to implement SEQ:

* Clocked register
* Hardware units
* Control logic blocks
* Wire names
* Word-wide data
* Byte and narrower data connections
* Single-bit connections

Four register ID signals:

* `srcA`, the source of `valA`;
* `srcB`, the source of `valB`;
* `dstE`, the register to which `valE` gets written;
* `dstM`, the register to which `valM` gets written.

### 4.3.3 SEQ Timing

* The program counter is loaded with a new instruction address every clock
  cycle.
* The condition code register is loaded only when an integer operation
  instruction is executed.
* The data memory is written only when an `rmmovq`, `pushq`, or `call`
  instruction is executed.
* The two write ports of the register file allow two program registers to be
  updated on every cycle, but we can use the special register ID `0xF` as a
  port address to indicate that no write should be performed for this port.

Some instructions (the integer operations) set the CC, and some instructions
(the conditional move and jump instructions) read these CC, but no instruction
must both set and then read the condition codes. Even though the condition
codes are not set until the clock rises to begin the next clock cycle, they
will be updated before any instruction attempts to read them.

We show the register file and the data memory as having separate connections
for reading and writing, since the read operations propagate through these
units as if they were combinational logic, while the write operations are
controlled by the clock.

### 4.5.4 Next PC Prediction

The PIPEâˆ’ *fetch* stage, diagrammed at the bottom of, is responsible for both
predicting the **next value of the PC** and selecting the actual PC for
the instruction *fetch*.

**Select PC** chooses one of three values to serve as the address for the
instruction memory:

* The predicted PC,
* The value of `valP` for a not-taken branch instruction that reaches pipeline
  register M (stored in regis-ter `M_valA`),
* The value of the return address when a `ret` instruction reaches pipeline
  register `W` (stored in `W_valM`).


### 4.5.5 Pipeline Hazards

A data hazard can arise for an instruction when one of its operands is updated
by any of the three preceding instructions.

#### Avoiding Data Hazards by Stalling

#### Avoiding Data Hazards by Forwarding

* Forwarding of values generated by the ALU and destined for write port E.
* Forwarding can also be used with values read from the memory and destined for
  write port M.
* From the memory stage, we can forward the value that has just been read from
  the data memory (signal `m_valM`).
* From the write-back stage, we can forward the pending write to port M (signal
  `W_valM`).
* This gives a total of five different forwarding sources (`e_valE`, `m_valM`,
  `M_valE`, `W_valM`, and `W_valE`) and two different forwarding destinations
  (`valA` and `valB`).

#### Load/Use Data Hazards

```
mrmovq 0(%rdx), %rax # Load %rax
addq %ebx, %eax      # Use %rax
```

#### Avoiding Control Hazards

### 4.5.6 Exception Handling

* First, it is possible to have exceptions triggered by multiple instructions
  simultaneously.
* A second subtlety occurs when an instruction is first fetched and begins
  execution, causes an exception, and later is canceled due to a mispredicted
  branch.
* A third subtlety arises because a pipelined processor updates different parts
  of the system state in different stages. 

### 4.5.7 PIPE Stage Implementations

#### PC Selection and Fetch Stage

This stage must also select a current value for the program counter and predict
the next PC value.

```
word f_pc = [
    # Mispredicted branch. Fetch at incremented PC
    M_icode == IJXX && !M_Cnd : M_valA;

    # Completion for RET instruction
    W_icode == IRET : W_valM;

    # Default: Use predicted value of PC
    1 : F_predPC;
];

word f_predPC = [
    f_icode in { IJXX, ICALL } : f_valC;
    1 : f_valP;
];

word f_stat = [
    immem_error : SADR;
    !instr_valid : SINS;
    f_icode == IHLT : SHLT;
    1 : SAOK;
];

bool need_regids = f_icode in [
    IRRMOVQ, IIRMOVQ, IRMMOVQ, IMRMOVQ, IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, IOPQ
];

bool need_valC = f_icode in [
    IIRMOVQ, IRMMOVQ, IMRMOVQ, IJXX, ICALL
];

bool instr_valid = f_icode in [
    IRRMOVQ, IIRMOVQ, IRMMOVQ, IMRMOVQ,
    IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, IOPQ, IJXX, ICALL, IRET
];
```

#### Decode and Write-Back Stages

```python
word d_srcA = [
    D_icode in { IRRMOVQ, IRMMOVQ, IOP, IPUSHQ } : D_rA;
    D_icode in { IPOPQ, IRET } : RRSP;
    1 : RNONE;
];

word d_srcB = [
    D_icode in { IOPQ, IRMMOVQ, IMRMOVQ } : D_rB;
    D_icode in { IPUSHQ, IPOPQ , ICALL, IRET } : RRSP;
    1 : RNONE;
];

word d_dstE = [
    D_icode in { IRRMOVQ, IIRMOVQ, IOPQ } : D_rB;
    D_icode in { IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, ICALL, IRET } : RRSP;
    1 : RNONE;
];

word d_dstM = [
    D_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ } : D_rA
    1 : RNONE;
];

word f_stat = [
    imem_error : SADR;
    !instr_valid : SINS;
    f_icode == IHALT : SHLT;
    1 : SAOK;
]

word d_valA = [
    D_icode in { ICALL, IJXX } : D_valP; # Use incremented PC
    d_srcA == e_dstE : e_valE;    # Forward valE from execute
    d_srcA == M_dstM : m_valM;    # Forward valM from memory
    d_srcA == M_dstE : M_valE;    # Forward valE from memory
    d_srcA == W_dstM : W_valM;    # Forward valM from write back
    d_srcA == W_dstE : W_valE;    # Forward valE from write back
    1 : d_rvalA;    # Use value read from register file
];

word d_valB = [
    d_srcB == e_dstE : e_valE;
    d_srcB == M_dstM : m_valM;
    d_srcB == M_dstE : M_valE;
    d_srcB == W_dstM : W_valM;
    d_srcB == W_dstE : W_valE;
    1 : d_rvalB;
];

word m_stat = [
    dmem_error : SADR;
    1 : M_stat;
];

word Stat = [
    # Bubble in write-back stage
    W_stat = SBUB : SAOK;
    1 : W_stat;
];
```

* Our pipelined implementation should always give priority to the forwarding
  source in the earliest pipeline stage, since it holds the latest instruction
  in the program sequence setting the register.
* The forwarding priority between the two sources in either the memory or the
  write-back stages is only a concern for the instruction `popq %rsp`, since
  only this instruction can attempt two simultaneous writes to the same
  register.

| Data   | word   | Register | ID Source description               |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| e_valE | e_dstE | ALU      | output                              |
| m_valM | M_dstM | Memory   | output                              |
| M_valE | M_dstE | Pending  | write to port E in memory stage     |
| W_valM | W_dstM | Pending  | write to port M in write-back stage |
| W_valE | W_dstE | Pending  | write to port E in write-back stage |

If none of the forwarding conditions hold, the block should select `d_rvalA`,
the value read from register port A, as its output.

#### Execute Stage

One difference is that the logic labeled "Set CC," which determines whether or
not to update the condition codes, has signals `m_stat` and `W_stat` as inputs.
These signals are used to detect cases where an instruction causing an
exception is passing through later pipeline stages, and therefore any updating
of the condition codes should be suppressed.

#### Memory Stage

### 4.5.8 Pipeline Control Logic

* Load/use hazards. The pipeline must stall for one cycle between an
  instruction that reads a value from memory and an instruction that uses this
  value.
* Processing ret. The pipeline must stall until the `ret` instruction reaches
  the write-back stage.
* Mispredicted branches. By the time the branch logic detects that a jump
  should not have been taken, several instructions at the branch target will
  have started down the pipeline. These instructions must be canceled, and
  fetching should begin at the instruction following the jump instruction.
* Exceptions. When an instruction causes an exception, we want to disable the
  updating of the programmer-visible state by later instructions and halt
  execution once the excepting instruction reaches the write-back stage.

### Desired Handling of Special Control Cases

For load/use Hazards Only the `mrmovq` and `popq` instructions read data from
memory. When

1. either of these is in the execute stage and 
2. an instruction requiring the destination register is in the decode stage

We want to hold back the second instruction in the decode stage and inject a
bubble into the execute stage on the next cycle. After this, the forwarding
logic will resolve the data hazard.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a mispredicted branch occurs

1. The misprediction will be detected as the jump instruction reaches the
   execute stage.
2. The control logic then injects bubbles into the decode and execute stages on
   the next cycle, causing the two incorrectly fetched instructions to be
   canceled.
3. On the same cycle, the pipeline reads the correct instruction into the fetch
   stage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the processing of a `ret` instruction, The pipeline should stall for three
cycles until the return address is read as the ret instruction passes through
the memory stage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For an instruction that causes an exception

1. Exceptions are detected during two different stages (fetch and memory) of
   program execution, and 
2. The program state is updated in three different stages (execute, memory, and
   write-back).

As the excepting instruction reaches the memory stage, we take steps to prevent
later instructions from modifying the programmer-visible state by

1. disabling the setting of condition codes by instructions in the execute
   stage,
2. injecting bubbles into the memory stage to disable any writing to the data
   memory, and
3. stalling the write-back stage when it has an excepting instruction, thus
   bringing the pipeline to a halt.

#### Detecting Special Control Conditions

| Condition           | Trigger                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processing ret      | IRET in {D_icode, E_icode, M_icode}                         |
| Load/use hazard     | E_icode in {IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ} && E_dstM âˆˆ {d_srcA, d_srcB}    |
| Mispredicted branch | E_icode = IJXX && !e_Cnd                                    |
| Exception           | m_stat in {SADR, SINS, SHLT} || W_stat âˆˆ {SADR, SINS, SHLT} |

#### Pipeline Control Mechanisms

| Condition           | F      | D      | E      | M      | W      |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Processing ret      | stall  | bubble | normal | normal | normal |
| Load/use hazard     | stall  | stall  | bubble | normal | normal |
| Mispredicted branch | normal | bubble | bubble | normal | normal |

#### Combination of Control Conditions

Combination A involves a not-taken jump instruction in the execute stage and a
ret instruction in the decode stage.

| Condition           | F      | D      | E      | M      | W      |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Processing ret      | stall  | bubble | normal | normal | normal |
| Mispredicted branch | normal | bubble | bubble | normal | normal |
| Combination         | stall  | bubble | bubble | normal | normal |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combination B involves a load/use hazard, where the loading instruction sets
register `%rsp` and the `ret` instruction then uses this register as a source
operand, since it must pop the return address from the stack.

| Condition           | F      | D      | E      | M      | W      |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Processing ret      | stall  | bubble | normal | normal | normal |
| Load/use hazard     | stall  | stall  | bubble | normal | normal |
| Combination         | stall  | b+s    | bubble | normal | normal |
| Desired             | stall  | stall  | bubble | normal | normal |

#### Control Logic Implementation

```python
bool F_stall =
    # Conditions for a load/use hazard
    E_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ } && E_dstM in { d_srcA, d_srcB } ||
    # Stalling at fetch while ret passes through pipeline
    IRET in { D_icode, E_icode, M_icode };

bool D_bubble =
    # Mispredicted branch
    (E_icode == IJXX && !e_Cnd) ||
    # Stalling at fetch while ret passes through pipeline
    # but not condition for a load/use hazard
    !(E_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ } && E_dstM in { d_srcA, d_srcB }) && IRET in { D_icode, E_icode, M_icode };
```
