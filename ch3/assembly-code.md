### 3.4.1 Operand Specifier

Three different operand types:

* immediate
* register
* memory

> $Imm(r_b, r_i, s)$, where $s$ must be 64-bit registers.

### 3.4.2 Data Movement Instructions

x86-64 imposes the restriction that a move instruction cannot have both
operands refer to memory locations. Copying a value from one memory location
to another requires two instructions—the first to load the source value into
a register, and the second to write this register value to the destination.

```
movabsq $0x0011223344556677, %rax      ; %rax = 0011223344556677
movb $-1, %al                          ; %rax = 00112233445566FF
movw $-1, %ax                          ; %rax = 001122334455FFFF
movl $-1, %eax                         ; %rax = 00000000FFFFFFFF
movq $-1, %rax                         ; %rax = FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```

* When `movl` has a register as the destination, it will also set the
  high-order 4 bytes of the register to 0.
* The regular `movq` instruction can only have immediate source operands that can
  be represented as 32-bit two’s-complement numbers. This value is then sign
  extended to produce the 64-bit value for the destination.
* The `movabsq` instruction can have an arbitrary 64-bit immediate value as its
  source operand and can only have a register as a destination.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
movzbw
movzbl
movzbq
movzwl
movzwq
# movzlq can be implemented with movl

movsbw
movsbl
movsbq
movswl
movswq
movslq
cltq      # sign-extend %eax to %rax
```

* Instructions in the `MOVZ` class fill out the remaining bytes of the
  destination with zeros.
* While those in the `MOVS` class fill them out by sign extension, replicating
  copies of the most significant bit of the source operand.
* for 64-bit destinations, moving with sign extension is supported for all
  three source types, and moving with zero extension is supported for the two
  smaller source types.

### 3.4.3 Pushing and Popping Stack Data

The stack pointer `%rsp` holds the address of the top stack element.

Pushing a quad word value onto the stack involves first decrementing the stack
pointer by 8 and then writing the value at the new top-of-stack address.

```
# pushq %rbp is equivalent to:
subq $8, %rsp       # decrement stack pointer
movq %rbp, (%rsp)   # store %rbp on stack
```

Popping a quad word involves reading from the top-of-stack location and then
incrementing the stack pointer by 8. 

```
popq %rax is equivalent to:
movq (%rsp), %rax
addq $8, %rsp
```

> Local variables such as x are often kept in registers rather than stored in
> memory locations. 

## 3.5 Arithmetic and Logical Operations

| Instructions | Effect       | Description              |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| leaq S, D    | D <- &S      | Load effective address   |
| inc D        | D <- D+1     | Increment                |
| dec D        | D <- D−1     | Decrement                |
| neg D        | D <- -D      | Negate                   |
| not D        | D <- ~D      | Complement               |
| add S, D     | D <- D + S   | Add                      |
| sub S, D     | D <- D − S   | Subtract                 |
| imul S, D    | D <- D * S   | Multiply                 |
| xor S, D     | D <- D ^ S   | Exclusive-or             |
| or S, D      | D <- D | S   | Or                       |
| and S, D     | D <- D & S   | And                      |
| sal k, D     | D <- D << k  | Left shift               |
| shl k, D     | D <- D << k  | Left shift (same as sal) |
| sar k, D     | D <- D >>A^k | Arithmetic right shift   |
| shr k, D     | D <- D >>L^k | Logical right shift      |

### 3.5.1 Load Effective Address

> Compilers often find clever uses of leaq that have nothing to do with
> effective address computations. The destination operand must be a register.

```c
long scale(long x, long y, long z) {
    long t = x + 4 * y + 12 * z;
    return t;
}
```

```
leaq (%rdi, %rsi, 4), %rax
leaq (%rdx, %rdx, 2), %rdx
leaq (%rax, %rdx, 4), %rax
```

### 3.5.2 Unary and Binary Operations

### Shift Operations

The different shift instructions can specify the shift amount either as an
immediate value or with the single-byte register `%cl`.

With x86-64, a shift instruction operating on data values that are w bits long
determines the shift amount from the low-order `m` bits of register `%cl`, where
$2^m=w$. The higher-order bits are ignored.

So, for example, when register `%cl` has hexadecimal value 0xFF, then instruction
`salb` would shift by 7, while `salw` would shift by 15, `sall` would shift by
31, and `salq` would shift by 63.

### 3.5.5 Special Arithmetic Operations

* One for unsigned `mulq` and one for two’s-complement `imulq` multiplication.
* For both of these instructions, one argument must be in register `%rax`, and
  the other is given as the instruction source operand.
* The product is then stored in registers `%rdx` (high-order 64 bits) and `%rax`
  (low-order 64 bits).

```c
void store_uprod(uint128_t *dest, uint64_t x, uint64_t y) {
    *dest = x * (uint128_t) y;
}
```

```
movq %rsi, %rax
mulq %rdx
movq %rax, (%rdi)
movq %rdx, 8(%rdi)
ret
```

* Since the code is generated for a little-endian machine, the high-order bytes
  are stored at higher addresses, as indicated by the address specification
  8(%rdi).

---

* The signed division instruction `idivl` takes as its dividend the 128-bit
  quantity in registers `%rdx` (high-order 64 bits) and `%rax` (low-order 64
  bits).
* The divisor is given as the instruction operand.
* The instruction stores the quotient in register `%rax` and the remainder in
  register `%rdx`.
  
For most applications of 64-bit addition, the dividend is given as a 64-bit
value. This value should be stored in register `%rax`. The bits of `%rdx`
should then be set to either all zeros (unsigned arithmetic) or the sign bit of
`%rax` (signed arithmetic).

```c
void remdiv(long x, long y, long * qp, long * rp) {
    long q = x / y;
    long r = x % y;
    *qp = q;
    *rp = r;
}
```

```
movq %rdx, %r8
movq %rdi, %rax
cqto              ; sign-extend to upper 8 bytes of dividend
idivl %rsi
movq %rax, (%r8)
movq %rdx, (%rcx)
ret
```

* `cqto` This instruction takes no operands—it implicitly reads the sign bit
  from %rax and copies it across all of %rdx.

## 3.6 Control

### 3.6.1 Condition Codes

```
CF    (unsigned) t < (unsigned) a           ; unsigned overflow
ZERO  (t == 0)                              ; zero
SF    (t < 0)                               ; negative
OF    (a < 0 == b < 0) && (t < 0 != a < 0)  ; signed overflow
```

* The `leaq` instruction does not alter any condition codes, since it is
  intended to be used in address computations.
* For the logical operations, such as `xor`, the carry and overflow flags are
  set to zero.
* For the shift operations, the carry flag is set to the last bit shifted out,
  while the overflow flag is set to zero.
* For reasons that we will not delve into, the `inc` and `dec` instructions set
  the overflow and zero flags, but they leave the carry flag unchanged.

| Instruction | Based on       | Description         |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| cmp         | S1, S2 S2 − S1 | Compare             |
| cmpb        |                | Compare byte        |
| cmpw        |                | Compare word        |
| cmpl        |                | Compare double word |
| cmpq        |                | Compare quad word   |
|             |                |                     |
| test        | S1, S2 S1 & S2 | Test                |
| testb       |                | Test byte           |
| testw       |                | Test word           |
| testl       |                | Test double word    |
| testq       |                | Test quad word      |

> Typically, the same operand is repeated (e.g., testq %rax,%rax to see whether
> %rax is negative, zero, or positive), or one of the operands is a mask
> indicating which bits should be tested.

### 3.6.2 Accessing the Condition Codes

| Instruction | Synonym  | Effect                | Set condition                |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------  | ---------------------------- |
| `sete`      | `setz`   | D <- `ZF`             | Equal/zero                   |
| `setne`     | `setnz`  | D <- `~ZF`            | Not equal / not zero         |
| `sets`      |          | D <- `SF`             | Negative                     |
| `setns`     |          | D <- `~SF`            | Nonnegative                  |
| `setg`      | `setnle` | D <- `~(SF^OF) & ~ZF` | Greater (signed >)           |
| `setge`     | `setnl`  | D <- `~(SF^OF)`       | Greater or equal (signed >=) |
| `setl`      | `setnge` | D <- `SF^OF`          | Less (signed <)              |
| `setle`     | `setng`  | D <- `(SF^OF) | ZF`   | Less or equal (signed <=)    |
| `seta`      | `setnbe` | D <- `CF ^ ~ZF`       | Above (unsigned >)           |
| `setae`     | `setnb`  | D <- `~CF`            | Above or equal (unsigned >=) |
| `setb`      | `setnae` | D <- `CF`             | Below (unsigned <)           |
| `setbe`     | `setna`  | D <- `CF | ZF`        | Below or equal(unsigned <=)  |

```
cmpq %rsi, %rdi
setl %al
movzbl %al, %eax  ; Clear rest of %eax (and rest of %rax)
ret
```

* Similarly, consider testing for signed comparison with the `setl`, or "set
  when less," instruction. When no overflow occurs (indicated by having `OF`
  set to 0), we will have a < b when a -t w b < 0, indicated by having `SF` set
  to 1, and a ≥ b when a -t w b ≥ 0, indicated by having `SF` set to 0.
* On the other hand, when overflow occurs, we will have a < b when a -t w b > 0
  (negative overflow) and a > b when a -t w b < 0 (positive overflow). We
  cannot have overflow when a = b. Thus, when `OF` is set to 1, we will have a
  < b if and only if `SF` is set to 0. Combining these cases, the exclusive-or
  of the overflow and sign bits provides a test for whether a < b.

### 3.6.3 Jump Instructions

```
  movq $0, %rax
  jmp .L1
  movq (%rax), %rdx     # Null pointer dereference (skipped)
.L1:
  popq %rdx
```

| Instruction    | Synonym | Jump condition   |

| `jbe`          | `jna`   | `CF | ZF`        |

### 3.6.4 Jump Instruction Encodings

* The value of the program counter when performing PC-relative addressing is
  the address of the instruction *following the jump*, not that of the jump
  itself.
* This convention dates back to early implementations, when the processor would
  update the program counter as its first step in executing an instruction.

### 3.6.5 Implementing Conditional Branches with Conditional Control

```
if (test-expr)

  else-statement
```

```
  t = (test-expr)
  if (!t)
    goto false:
  then-statement

```

### 3.6.6 Implementing Conditional Branches with Conditional Moves

1. Conditional transfer of *control*
2. Conditional transfer of *data*

```
absdiff:
  movq %rsi, %rax
  subq %rdi, %rax   # rval = y-x
  movq %rdi, %rdx
  subq %rsi, %rdx   # eval = x-y
  cmpq %rsi, %rdi   # Compare x:y
  cmovge %rdx, %rax # If >=, rval = eval
  ret               # Return tval
```

| Instruction | Synonym | Move condition   | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------   | -----------                     |
| cmove S, R  | cmovz   | ZF               | Equal / zero                    |
| cmovne S, R | cmovnz  | ~ZF              | Not equal / not zero            |
| cmovs S, R  |         | SF               | Negative                        |

| cmovae S, R | cmovnb  | ~CF              | Above or equal (Unsigned >=)    |
| cmovb S, R  | cmovnae | CF               | Below (unsigned <)              |
| cmovbe S, R | cmovna  | CF               | ZF Below or equal (unsigned <=) |

```
v = test-expr ? then-expr : else-expr;

# standard way
    if (!test-expr)
        goto false;
    v = then-expr;
    goto done;
false:
    v = else-expr;
done:

# conditional move way
v = then-expr;
ve = else-expr;
t = test-expr;
if (!t) v = ve;
```

* For the code based on a conditional move, both the then-expr and the
  else-expr are evaluated, with the final value chosen based on the evaluation
    test-expr.

Not all conditional expressions can be compiled using conditional moves. Most
significantly, the abstract code we have shown evaluates both then-expr and
else-expr regardless of the test outcome. If one of those two expressions could
  possibly generate an error condition or a side effect, this could lead to
  invalid behavior.

### 3.6.7 Loops


#### Do-while loops

```
loop:
    body-statements
    t = test-expr
    if (t)
        goto loop
```

```
fact_do:
  movl $1, %eax
.L2:
  imulq %rdi %rax
  subq  $1   %rdi
  cmpq  $1   %rdi
  jg    .L2
  rep; ret
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### While Loop (Jump-to-middle)

```
    goto test;
loop:
    body-statement
test:
    t = test-expr
    if (t)
        goto loop;
```

```
  movl  $1, %rax
  jmp   .L5
.L6
  imulq %rdi, %rax
  subq  $1, %rdi
.L5
  cmpq  $1, %rdi
  jg    .L6
  rep;ret
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### While Loops (Guaded-do)

```
    t = test-expr
    if (!t)
        goto done;
loops:
    body-statement
    t = test-expr;
    if (t)
          goto loop;
done:
```

```
fact_while:
  movl %1, %eax
  cmpq $1, %rdi
  jle  .L7
.L6
  imulq %rdi, %rax
  subq  $1, %rdi
  cmpq  $1, %rdi
  jne   .L6
  rep; ret
.L7
  ret
```

* By using a conditional branch to skip over the loop if the initial test
  fails.
* Using this implementation strategy, the compiler can often optimize the
  initial test, for example, determining that the test condition will always
  hold.

### 3.6.8 Switch Statements

A jump table is an array where entry i is the address of a code segment
implementing the action the program should take when the switch index equals i.
The code performs an array reference into the jump table using the switch index
to determine the target for a jump instruction.

     %rsp  ---> +-------------------+
                    Stack "top"
```

* When procedure P calls procedure Q, it will push the return address onto the
  stack, indicating where within P the program should resume execution once Q
  returns. We consider the return address to be part of P’s stack frame, since
  it holds state relevant to P.
* The stack frames for most procedures are of fixed size, allocated at the
  beginning of the procedure. Some procedures, however, require variable-size
  frames.
* Procedure P can pass up to six integral values (i.e., pointers and integers)
  on the stack, but if Q requires more arguments, these can be stored by P
  within its stack frame prior to the call.

### 3.7.2 Control Transfer

The `call Q` instruction pushes an address `A` onto the stack and sets the `PC`
to the beginning of `Q`. The pushed address `A` is referred to as the return
address and is computed as the address of the instruction immediately following
the call instruction. The counterpart instruction `ret` pops an address `A` off
the stack and sets the PC to `A`.

### 3.7.3 Data Transfer

* When passing parameters on the stack, all data sizes are rounded up to be
  multiples of eight.
* If Q, in turn, calls some function that has more than six arguments, it can
  allocate space within its stack frame for these, as is illustrated by the
  area labeled "Argument build area"

### 3.7.4 Local Storage on the Stack

         Argumment 7 ------------
```

### 3.7.5 Local Storage in Registers

* By convention, registers `%rbx`, `%rbp`, and `%r12–%r15` are classified as
  callee-saved registers. When procedure P calls procedure Q, Q must preserve
  the values of these registers, ensuring that they have the same values when Q
  returns to P as they did when Q was called.
* Procedure Q can preserve a register value by either not changing it at all or
  by pushing the original value on the stack, altering it, and then popping the
  old value from the stack before returning.
* The pushing of register values has the effect of creating the portion of the
  stack frame labeled "Saved registers"
* All other registers, except for the stack pointer `%rsp`, are classified as
  caller-saved registers.

```

### 3.8.4 Fixed-Size Arrays

## 3.9 Heterogeneous Data Structures

### 3.9.1 Structures

```c
struct rec {
    int i;
    int j;
    int a[2];
    int *p;
};
```

```
0      4      8             16            24
+------+------+------+------+------+------+
|   i  |  j   | a[0] | a[1] |      p      |
+------+------+------+------+------+------+
```

```
movl  (%rdi), %rax  # get r->i
movl  %eax, 4(%rdi) # Store in r->j
```

To generate a pointer to an object within a structure, we can simply add the
field's offset to the structure address. For example, we can generate the
pointer `&(r->a[1])` by adding offset `8 + 4 * 1 = 12`. For pointer `r` in
register `%rdi` and long integer variable i in register `%rsi`, we can generate
the pointer value `&(r->a[i])` with the single instruction:

```
leaq  8(%rdi, %rsi, 4), %rax  # set %rax to &r->a[i]

r->p = &r->a[r->i + r->j];
Registers: r in %rdi
----------------------------------------------------

movl 4(%rdi), %eax       # Get r->j
addl (%rdi), %eax        # Add r->i
cltq                     # Extend to 8 bytes
leaq (%rdi,%rax,4), %rax # Compute &r->a[r->i + r->j]
movq %rax, 16(%rdi)      # Store in r->p
```

### 3.9.2 Unions

```c
union U3 {
    char c;
    int i[2];
    double v;
};
```

* For pointer `p` of type `union U3 *`, references `p->c`, `p->i[0]`, and
  `p->v` would all reference the beginning of the data structure.
* Observe also that the overall size of a union equals the *maximum size* of any
  of its fields.

One application is when we know in advance that the use of two different fields
in a data structure will be mutually exclusive. Then, declaring these two
fields as part of a union rather than a structure will reduce the total space
allocated.

Suppose we want to implement a binary tree data structure where each leaf node
has two double data values and each internal node has pointers to two children
but no data.

```c
struct node_s {
    struct node_s *left;
    struct node_s *right;
    double data[2];
};    // requires 32 bytes

union node_u {
    struct {
        union node_u *left;
        union node_u *right;
    } internal;
    double data[2];
};
```

* Then every node will require just 16 bytes.
* If n is a pointer to a node of type union `node_u *`, we would reference the
  data of a leaf node as `n->data[0]` and `n->data[1]` and the children of an
  internal node as `n->internal.left` and `n->internal.right`.

There is no way to determine whether a given node is a leaf or an internal
node. A common method is to introduce an enumer- ated type defining the
different possible choices for the union, and then create a structure
containing a tag field and the union:

```c
typedef enum {
  N_LEAF,
  N_INTERNAL
} nodetype_t;

struct node_t {
  nodetype_t type;
  union {
    struct {
      struct node_t* left;
      struct node_t* right;
    } internal;
    double data[2];
  } info;
};    // requires 24 bytes
```

Unions can also be used to access the bit patterns of different data types.

```c
unsigned long u = (unsigned long) d
```

* Value `u` will be an integer representation of `d`. Except for the case where
  `d` is `0.0`, the bit representation of `u` will be very different from that
  of `d`.

```c
unsigned long double2bits(double d) {
  union {
    double d;
    unsigned long u;
  } temp;
  temp.d = d;
  return return temp.u;
}
```

* The result will be that u will have the same bit representation as d,
  including fields for the sign bit


```c
double uu2double(unsigned word0, unsigned word1) {
  union {
    double d;
    unsigned u[2];
  } temp;
  temp.u[0] = word0;
  temp.u[1] = word1;
  return temp.d;
}
```

On a little-endian machine, such as an x86-64 processor, argument `word0` will
become the low-order 4 bytes of `d`, while `word1` will become the high-order 4
bytes. On a big-endian machine, the role of the two arguments will be reversed.

### 3.9.3 Data Alignment

For code involving structures, the compiler may need to insert gaps in the
field allocation to ensure that each structure element satisfies its alignment
requirement. The structure will then have some required alignment for its
starting address.

## 3.10 Combining Control and Data in Machine-Level Programs

### 3.10.1 Understanding Pointers

Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value.
One effect of casting is to change any scaling of pointer arithmetic. So, for
example, if `p` is a pointer of type `char *` having value `p`, then the
expression `(int *) p+7` computes `p + 28`, while `(int *) (p+7)` computes `p +
7`. (Recall that casting has higher precedence than addition.)

```c
int fun(int x, int* p);
int (*fp)(int x, int* p);

fp = fun;

int y = 1;
int result = fp(3, &y);
```

* The value of a function pointer is the address of the first instruction in
  the machine-code representation of the function.

Unfortunately, a number of commonly used library functions, including `strcpy`,
`strcat`, and `sprintf`, have the property that they can generate a byte sequence
without being given any indication of the size of the destination buffer [97]

Typically, the program is fed with a string that contains the byte encoding of some
executable code, called the *exploit code*, plus some extra bytes that overwrite the
return address with a pointer to the exploit code. The effect of executing the ret
instruction is then to jump to the exploit code.

### 3.10.4 Thwarting Buffer Overflow Attacks

#### Stack Randomnizaiton

#### Stack Corruption Detection

stack protector: store a special canary value in the stack frame between any
local buffer and the rest of the stack state

```
echo:
  $24, %rsp                 # Allocate 24 bytes on stack
  movq %fs:40, %rax         # Retrieve canary
  movq %rax, 8(%rsp)        # Store on stack
  xorl %eax, %eax           # Zero out register
  movq %rsp, %rdi           # Compute buf as %rsp
  call gets                 # Call gets
  movq %rsp, %rdi           # Compute buf as %rsp
  call puts                 # Call puts
  movq (%rsp), %rax         # Retrieve canary
  xorq %fs:40, %rax         # Compare to stored value
  je .L9                    # If =, goto ok
  call __stack_chk_fail     # Stack corrupted!
.L9:                        # ok:
  addq $24, %rsp            # Deallocate stack space
  ret
```

* The instruction argument `%fs:40` is an indication that the canary value is
  read from memory using segmented addressing
* By storing the canary in a special segment, it can be marked as "read only,"
  so that an attacker cannot overwrite the stored canary value.
* GCC only inserts it when there is a local buffer of type char in the
  function.

#### Limiting Executable Code Regions

One method is to limit which memory regions hold executable code. In typical
programs, only the portion of memory holding the code generated by the compiler
need be executable. The other portions can be restricted to allow just reading
and writing.

The hardware supports different forms of `memory protection`, indicating the
forms of access allowed by both user programs and the operating system kernel.
Many systems allow control over three forms of access:

* read (reading data from memory),
* write (storing data into memory),
* and execute (treating the memory contents as machine-level code).

### 3.10.5 Supporting Variable-Size Stack Frames

```c
long vframe(long n, long idx, long *q) {
  long i;
  long *p[n];
  p[0] = &i;
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
    p[i] = q;
  return *p[idx];
}
```

```
vframe:
  pushq %rbp                        Save old %rbp
  movq  %rsp, %rbp                  Set frame pointer
  subq  $16, %rsp                   Allocate space for i (%rsp = s_1)
  leaq  22(,%rdi,8), %rax
  andq  $-16, %rax
  subq  %rax, %rsp                  Allocate space for array p (%rsp = s_2)
  leaq  7(%rsp), %rax
  shrq  $3, %rax
  leaq  0(,%rax,8), %r8             Set %r8 to &p[0]
  movq  %r8, %rcx                   Set %rcx to &p[0] (%rcx = p)

# . . .
# Code for initialization loop
# i in %rax and on stack, n in %rdi, p in %rcx, q in %rdx

.L3:                              loop:
  movq  %rdx, (%rcx,%rax,8)         Set p[i] to q
  addq  $1, %rax                    Increment i
  movq  %rax, -8(%rbp)              Store i on stack
.L2:
  movq  -8(%rbp), %rax              Retrieve i from stack
  cmpq  %rdi, %rax                  Compare i:n
  jl    .L3                         If <, goto loop

# . . .
# Code for function exit

  leave                             Restore %rbp and %rsp
  ret                               Return
```

Suffice it to say that by the time the program reaches line 11, it has

1. allocated at least 8n bytes on the stack and
2. positioned array p within the allocated region such that at least 8n bytes
   are available for its use.

The frame pointer is restored to its previous value using the leave instruction

```
movq %rbp, %rsp       Set stack pointer to beginning of frame
popq %rbp             Restore saved %rbp and set stack ptr
                      to end of caller’s frame
```

registers for MMX, "XMM" for SSE, and "YMM" for AVX, ranging from 64 bits for
MM registers, to 128 for XMM, to 256 for YMM.
